## About Appointment
Build the backend of an api to manage users and appointments. 

During covid, my dentist office specifically kept calling me to change appointments- It made me wonder how things are done from their end and how to possibly make the experience better overall. 

This api is specifically for a dentistâ€™s office to help manage their database.

## Tech stack
    - Laravel/PHP
    - SQL

## Project setup
    - Run `composer install` in terminal
    - Use Postman or browser to visit api route
